Public Key Crypto, Math

* Recover ECDSA public key from signature/message pair (GH #664)

Utility Functions
------------------

* base58 encoding

Multiparty Protocols
----------------------

* Distributed key generation for DL, RSA
* Threshold signing, decryption

External Providers, Hardware Support
----------------------------------------

* Access to system certificate stores (Windows, OS X)
* Extend OpenSSL provider (DH, HMAC, CMAC, GCM)
* Support using BoringSSL instead of OpenSSL or LibreSSL
* /dev/crypto provider (ciphers, hashes)
* Windows CryptoAPI provider (ciphers, hashes, RSA)
* Apple CommonCrypto
* POWER8 crypto extensions (SHA-2, GCM)
* Better TPM support: NVRAM, PCR measurements, sealing
* Intel SGX support

TLS
----------------------------------------

* Make DTLS support optional at build time
* Improve/optimize DTLS defragmentation and retransmission
* Implement logging callbacks for TLS
* Make TLS v1.0 and v1.1 optional at build time
* Make RSA optional at build time
* Make finite field DH optional at build time
* TLS OCSP stapling (RFC 6066)
* Authentication using TOFU (sqlite3 storage)
* Certificate pinning (using TACK?)
* Certificate Transparency
* TLS supplemental authorization data (RFC 4680, RFC 5878)
* DTLS-SCTP (RFC 6083)
* Perspectives (http://perspectives-project.org/)
* Support for server key stored in TPM or PKCS #11

PKIX
----------------------------------------

* Further tests of validation API (see GH #785)
* Test suite for validation of 'real world' cert chains (GH #611)
* Improve output of X509_Certificate::to_string
  This is a free-form string for human consumption so the only constraints
  are being informative and concise. (GH #656)
* X.509 policy constraints
* OCSP responder logic
* X.509 attribute certificates (RFC 5755)
* Support generating/verifying XMSS certificates

New Protocols / Formats
----------------------------------------

* ORAM (Circuit-ORAM, Path-ORAM, ??)
* Roughtime client (https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime/)
* PKCS7 / Cryptographic Message Syntax
* PKCS12 / PFX
* NaCl compatible cryptobox functions
* Off-The-Record v3 https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/
* Fernet symmetric encryption (https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/)
* Some useful subset of OpenPGP
  - Subset #1: symmetrically encrypted files

    Not aiming to process arbitrary OpenPGP, but rather produce
    something that happens to be readable by `gpg` and is relatively
    simple to process for decryption. Require a 128-bit block cipher
    and MDC packet.

  - Subset #2: Process OpenPGP public keys
  - Subset #3: Verification of OpenPGP signatures

Cleanups
-----------

* Split test_ffi.cpp into multiple files

Compat Headers
----------------

* OpenSSL compatible API headers: EVP, TLS, certificates, etc

FFI and Bindings
----------------------------------------

* Expose compression
* Expose more of X.509 (CRLs, OCSP, cert signing, etc)
* Expose TLS
* Write a CLI or HTTPS client in Python
* Rust API

Library Infrastructure
----------------------------------------

* Guarded integer type to prevent overflow bugs
* Add logging callbacks
* Add latency tracing framework

Build/Test
----------------------------------------

* Create Docker image for Travis that runs 16.04 and has all
  the tools we need pre-installed.
* Build/export Windows installer exe on AppVeyor
* Code signing for Windows installers
* Test runner python script that captures backtraces and other
  debug info during CI
* Run the TPM tests against an emulator
  (https://github.com/PeterHuewe/tpm-emulator)
* Add clang-tidy, clang-analyzer, cppcheck to CI

FIPS 140 Build
---------------------------------------

* Special build policy that disables all builtin crypto impls, then provides new
  FIPS 140 versions implemented using just calls to the OpenSSL FIPS module API
  plus wrapping the appropriate functions for self-tests and so on. This creates a
  library in FIPS 140 validated form (since there is no 'crypto' anymore from
  Botan, just the ASN.1 parser, TLS library, PKI etc all of which FIPS 140 does
  not care about) without the enormous hassle and expense of actually having to
  maintain a FIPS validation on Botan. Email Jack if you are interested in this.

CLI
----------------------------------------

* Change `tls_server` to be a tty<->socket app, like `tls_client` is,
  instead of a bogus echo server.
* `encrypt` / `decrypt` tools providing password and/or public key
  based file encryption

Documentation
----------------------------------------

* X.509 certs, path validation
* Specific docs covering one major topic (RSA, ECDSA, AES/GCM, ...)
* Some howto style docs (setting up CA, ...)
